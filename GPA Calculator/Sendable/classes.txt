# You should delete these comments once you're set up, they break the program.
# Formatting is basically this:
# Class name, number of credit hours, grade;
# Comma and semicolon sensitive, make sure to use them correctly.
# Line spaces don't matter, I recommend using a blank line to separate semesters.
# Yes, it's accurate. I've used this for months and it always lines up w/ UCF's numbers.
# MAKE SURE THIS FILE IS NAMED "classes.txt". CASE SENSITIVE! Won't work otherwise.
#
# Supports:
#	All letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)
#	+ & - grades (like A-, B+) EXCLUDING A+, F-, and F+ since UCF doesn't use those
#	S & U grades
